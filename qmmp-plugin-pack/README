Qmmp Plugin Pack

Plugin pack is a set of extra plugins for Qmmp.
Official home page: http://qmmp.ylsoftware.com/

Description:
- MPG123 - MPEG v1/2 layer1/2/3 decoder with use of the libmpg123 library
- FFap - enhanced Monkey's Audio (APE) decoder (24-bit samples and embedded cue support)
- XMP - module player with use of the libxmp library

Requirements:
- Qt >= 4.6
- qmmp 0.9.x
- taglib >= 1.7.0
- libmpg123 >= 1.13.0 (Optional)
- libxmp >= 4.2.0 (Optional)
- cmake >= 2.8.6 (for build only)
- yasm (for build only)

Attention! Plugin Pack build needs lrelease installed. The libqt4-devel package often contains this utility.

Configure:
cmake ./

Build:
make

Installation:
make install

If someone plugin (for example, MPG123 plugin) doesn't build or doesn't needed you can disable it
by running:
cmake ./ -DUSE_MPG123:BOOL=FALSE

Available options:
- USE_MPG123; USE_FFAP; USE_XMP (plugins)
- USE_ASM (assembler-level optimizations inside FFap decoder)


Also you can use ccmake for changing plugins configuration.
By default program will be installed in /usr/local. You can change default path by running:
cmake ./ -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=custom_path


In some cases, you can use qmake for building and installation.

Configure:
qmake

Build:
make

Installation:
make install INSTALL_ROOT=/usr/local


If someone module doesn't build or doesn't needed you can disable it
in qmmp-plugin-pack.pri file - just comment corresponding line( symbol '#').
Attention! By default all plugins are enabled by default.

Changing shared library install path (needed by some 64-bit distributions).
By default, all libraries and plugins will be installed to $(INSTALL PREFIX)/lib. You can change "lib"
to "lib64" by running qmake-qt4 or cmake with special parameter:
qmake-qt4 LIB_DIR=/lib64
or
cmake ./ -DLIB_DIR=lib64
